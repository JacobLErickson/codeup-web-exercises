    <p>I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I’m more honest and my words are more beautiful. The concept of Lorem Ipsum was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. design jobs non-competitive. Lorem Ispum is a choke artist. It chokes! Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee. Lorem Ipsum is FAKE TEXT!</p>

    <p>We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them. When other websites give you text, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending words that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I assume, are good words. Lorem Ipsum is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why it’s former users left it for something else. They made a good decision. Lorem Ipsum better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!</p>

    <p>I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok?</p>

    <p>I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable. It’s about making placeholder text great again. That’s what people want, they want placeholder text to be great again. The other thing with Lorem Ipsum is that you have to take out its family.</p>

    <p>You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text. Some people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't. I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words.
